# Motivation
Questions to ask

In this analysis, we want to know if one wants to earn in the top 10% in the industry, what opportunity out there one could get.

To be more specific, we have four questions in mind - 

1. Which **country or region** has the highest proportion of top 10% earners?

2. Which **employment** type has the highest proportion of top 10% earners?

3. Which **size of the organization** has the highest proportion of top 10% earners?

4. Which **age** group has the highest proportion of top 10% earners?

# Requiments
Python Libraries like pandas, numpy and plotly are needed.

# Summary of analysis
The dataset contains answers from 83,439 participants from Stack Overflow in the year of 2021. Out of those, 46,844 participants leave their income information. And from the analysis, we figure out, if one wants to earn in the top 10% (more than 160k USD) group, one could think about

1. Find a job in the U.S.
2. Gain and accumulate your experience. The industry rewards the veterans.
3. Join a big-size company, or work as an individual.
